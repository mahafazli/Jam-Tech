        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The versatility of virtual reality technology provides a unique opportunity for interacting in an immersive and realistic environment. Our project takes advantage of this experience in order to assist adults with autism in practicing social skills. Our goal was to create a proof-of-concept demonstrating that VR can be a more immersive environment to facilitate learning and practice social skills.</p>

        <h2>Peers</h2>
        <p>Dr. Sarah Howorth from UMaine COEHD who is the director of the PEERS® Lab at UMaine, requested this project on virtual video modeling of the social skills of adults with autism. It is based on the existing PEERS® curriculum, which is a formal process for teaching social skills, created by Dr. Elizabeth Laugeson from UCLA.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Development -->
    <section>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>This is a UMaine Computer Science Capstone project. The first semester is dedicated to acquiring requirements, planning, and drafting designs, while the second semester focuses on programming and implementing those designs.</p>
        <h3>Deliverables:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Requirements Specification</li>
            <li>Software Design Document</li>
            <li>User Interface Design Document</li>
            <li>Critical Design Review</li>
            <li>Code Inspection Report</li>
            <li>Administrative Manual</li>
            <li>User Guide</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Development Life Cycle:</h3>
        <p>The development of this project followed the Spiral Model. Each cycle of development progresses by determining objectives, identifying risks, code implementation, testing, and then planning for the next cycle. Each iteration produces a prototype of the final product, each with progressively more features implemented.</p>

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>The future goal of this project is for Dr. Howorth and colleagues to conduct research to investigate the effects of social skills taught in an immersive VR environment on the generalization of those skills in the real world. The results of these investigations may lead to the creation of a new product and grant funding for its development and further testing.</p>
